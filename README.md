# Square-Invaders
terminal based clone of Space Invaders(now with graphical version!)

So if you know the original Space Invaders, you understand the core conception.<br>
But there is moment, when game asks to solve simple math task and if answer is correct you get score,<br>
otherwise you get massive attack.

``` pip install keyboard``` - required library 1<br>
``` pip install pygame ``` - optional requirement 3 to play graphical version<br>

to run terminal version type ```python SquareInvaders classic```
